# Listsly
Listsly is a new take on google groups. To use the platform, simply send an email to any email address ending with `@lists.ly`. A new webpage will be created at http://lists.ly/<email> making all messages viewable from a web interface.

Email integration is supported by a webhook from Mandrill and processed in a queueing mechanism.

## The future
The plan is to integrate various different interfaces to adding messages. Including, IRC, SMS, and real time chat via a web interface.
